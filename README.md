## About

This app was inspired by this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day).

After installing some related apps and not being fully satisfied with any of them, I decided to create my own, featuring the two aspects that I wanted the most: Minimalist and 100% Private. 

Therefore, this app that will never collect any kind of data, display annoying ads or ask you to pay for anything. It's just a simple app that will help you to remember your life.

The idea itself is pretty simple:
 - Open the app in the moment of your day that you would like to remember in the future
 - Record or upload from gallery a short video (1 ~ 10 seconds)
 - That's it, open the app the next day and repeat the process

Then, after a couple months or even years:
 - Generate a compilation of all those videos, creating the movie of your life
